This repository is used to publish a [RevealJS](https://revealjs.com/) website that has been written in
[Quarto](https://www.quarto.org). It includes a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) which converts
the Quarto source to HTML and publish them via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The resulting webpage presentation can be viewed [here](https://ns-rse.github.io/osc-sheff).

If you wish to create a similar website presentation you can use the
[ns-rse/quarto-revealjs-template](https://github.com/ns-rse/quarto-revealjs-template). It includes instructions on how
to setup Quarto, publish locally and the settings required on GitHub.
