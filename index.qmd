**Vision**

_An inclusive, supportive & active community for researchers to interact, share knowledge and encourage good working
practices to normalise the values, transparency and culture of Open Scholarship._

**Mission**

* Interact
* Share
* Support
* Mentor

::: {.notes}
Describe the community what is the shared purpose of the community and who is it for? What is it people can gain by
joining your community. Include information from Missin and Vision, Community Engagement Plan and Communication Plan.

The Open Scholarship Community Sheffield vision is to be an inclusive, supportive and active community for researchers
to interact, share knowledge and encourage good working practices to normalise the values, transparency and culture of
Open Scholarship.

## Current Status

* :white_check_mark: Logo
* :white_check_mark: Core Team
* :white_check_mark: OSC Website
* :white_check_mark: Launch Event
* :white_check_mark: Community Activities
* Initial Members (after launch)

::: {.notes}
We have customised the logo and as you may have noticed opted for Scholarship over Science with an eye on inclusivity as
we did not want the Arts & Humanities or Library departments to feel excluded.

I've reached out to the Open Research Working Group which includes members of staff from across all faculties who are
already engaged in Open Scholarship to ask if anyone is interested in being a core member. Out of 14 respondents from
all faculties all but the Faculty of Science have someone willing to be a core member and point of contact in the
Faculty.

We have setup an OSC Website with the help of Ron XXX and Loek.

University of Sheffield ran its inaugural OpenFest event for the first time in 2022 and it returns this year in
September. I've been working with Jenni Adams, the Open Research Manager lead in Library Services who is organising this
event and she is very supportive and keen to be involved in the Open Scholarship Community. This years event runs over
four days with the first being in person and will close with a presentation from me on Open Communities and inviting
attendees.

## Up-coming Events

1. Launch OSC Sheffield at [OpenFest2023](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/library/research/open-research/openfest2023) 2023-09-07.
2. [Open Conversation](https://staff.sheffield.ac.uk/events/open-research-conversation) - TBC
3. [Quarto](https://quarto.org) for literate and reproducible documents
4. Rejuvenate [ReproducibiliTea Sheffield](https://reproducibilitea.org/#Sheffield).

::: {.notes}

With Jenni's support and input we have a number of events planned already.


Jenni already runs Open Conversation events which are regular seminars where researchers present their experience of
undertaking different aspects of Open Research. Topics and presenters are currently being organised by Jenni for Autumn
but past sessions have included Opening up Ethnography, You've Got to Fight for Your (Copy)right: An exploartion of New
Policies on Rights Retention.

The Open Research Working Group has monthly Drop-in sessions but these are poorly attended so we will be trying to
rejuvinate these by adding more structure

## Lessons Learned

1. Communities don't self-organise.
2. Policy and Infrastructure aren't enough.
3. Researchers in different areas have varying needs.

::: {.notes}

What have I learned about Community development from the Incubator programmer?

Probably the most important aspect I hadn't appreciated is that communities don't self-organise. That is particularly
true when the target audience are drawn from diverse and often disparate groups who don't already interact. I perhaps
naively thought that you just had to get people together, but without someone steering the boat and organising events
that bring people together I can see that communities won't grow.

Its all very well funders and institutions saying they are going to undertake Open Research but I hadn't given much
thought to the technical barriers that people encounter when having to learn new skills to make their work
reproducible. This is in part because I've always been self-motivated to try and learn new things about computing, but
undertaking the Incubator Programme and more recently Carpentries training has made me realise that there is a lot that
can be done to lessen the gradient of the learning curve when it comes to the digital literacy required to undertake
Open Research.

My background of scientific research and computing means I'm quite naive when it comes to more qualitative research such
as those in the Arts an Humanities, but researchers in these can and should be encouraged to undertake Open
Research. Its possible for data sources to be made available under the FAIR principles.
