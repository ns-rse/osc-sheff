## Current Status

* :white_check_mark: Logo
* :white_check_mark: Core Team
* :white_check_mark: OSC Website
* :white_check_mark: Launch Event
* Initial Members
* Community Activities

::: {.notes}
We have customised the logo and as you may have noticed opted for Scholarship over Science with an eye on inclusivity as
we did not want the Arts & Humanities or Library departments to feel excluded.

I've reached out to the Open Research Working Group which includes members of staff from across all faculties who are
already engaged in Open Scholarship to ask if anyone is interested in being a core member. Out of 14 respondents from
all faculties all but the Faculty of Science have someone willing to be a core member and point of contact in the
Faculty.

We have setup an OSC Website with the help of Ron XXX and Loek.

University of Sheffield ran its inaugural OpenFest event for the first time in 2022 and it returns this year in
September. I've been working with Jenni Adams, the Open Research Manager lead in Library Services who is organising this
event and is heavily involved in promoting Open Research at the University of Sheffield and she is very supportive and
keen to be involved herself. This years event runs over four days with the first being in person and will close with
a presentation from me Open Scholarship Community Sheffield inviting attendees to join the community (it aligns nicely
with drinks and socialising).

With Jenni's support and input we have a number of events planned already.

The Open Research Working Group has monthly Drop-in sessions but these are poorly attended so we will be trying to
