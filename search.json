By sharing experience and acting as mentors it supports and encourages the adoption and normalisation of Open Research practices.\nFurther interactions provide scope for and foster collaboration between individuals, groups, institutions and organisations and help improve transparency and openness in Research."

Out of 14 respondents 12 were willing to be involved as core members and these represent all but the Science faculty so we’ll need to do a bit more work to reach out and find someone interested there. We also have a PhD student who is keen to be involved to represent Postgraduate Researchers in the community.\nWe have setup an OSC Website with the help of Ron XXX and Loek.\nUniversity of Sheffield ran its inaugural OpenFest event for the first time in 2022 and it returns this year in September. I’ve been working with Jenni Adams, the Open Research Manager lead in Library Services who is organising this event and she is very supportive and keen to be involved in the Open Scholarship Community. This years event runs over four days with the first being in person and will close with a presentation from me on Open Communities and inviting attendees.\nI’ve also submitted an application for funding from Research Englands Culture funding call this year to fund some of my time and future events."

Topics and presenters are currently being organised by Jenni for Autumn but past sessions have included Opening up Ethnography, You’ve Got to Fight for Your (Copy)right: An exploartion of New Policies on Rights Retention.\nThe Open Research Working Group has monthly Drop-in sessions but these are poorly attended so we will be trying to rejuvinate these by adding more structure and I was planning on presenting or demonstrating using Quarto for literate and reproducible research.\nI’ve been in touch with those who have organised ReproducibiliTea Sheffield in the past about rejuvenating these journal clubs and they are keen and I’ll be working with them over the coming months to get those back up and running.\nIf the funding bid to Research England is successful we’ll be running a Reprohack in early 2024."

    "text": "Lessons Learned\n\nCommunities don’t self-organise.\nPolicy and Infrastructure aren’t enough.\nResearchers in different areas have varying needs.\n\n\nWhat have I learned about Community development from the Incubator programmer?\nProbably the most important aspect I hadn’t appreciated is that communities don’t self-organise. That is particularly true when the target audience are drawn from diverse and often disparate groups who don’t already interact. I perhaps naively thought that you just had to get people together, but without someone steering the boat and organising events that bring people together I can see that communities don’t naturally coalesce and won’t grow.\nIts all very well funders and institutions saying they are going to undertake Open Research but I hadn’t given much thought to the technical barriers that people encounter when having to learn new skills to make their work reproducible. This is in part because I’ve always been self-motivated to try and learn new things about computing, but undertaking the Incubator Programme and more recently Carpentries training has made me realise that there is a lot that can be done to lessen the gradient of the learning curve when it comes to the digital literacy required to undertake Open Research.\nMy background of scientific research and computing means I’m quite naive when it comes to more qualitative research such as those in the Arts an Humanities, but researchers in these can and should be encouraged to undertake Open Research. But it is possible to make data sources more Open and align with the FAIR principles by giving careful consideration to the formats data and other study materials are collected, stored and curated in, sharing these resources via tools such as Figshare and Zenodo to generate Digital Object Identifiers."
